# Awareness model

This model would be appropriete for public universities with a high community outreach. The student isn't just weighed in academic performance but also external factors. 

Ethnicity
I didn't feel the necessity to specify a favored ethnicity if the individual has shown some initiative for a higher education then that would suffice.

Income
I raised income score from 0.05 to 0.1
If the person comes from a low income family they would more than likely go through finacial hardship, and environmental stressors that would affect there perfomance.

Legacy
Removed - Felt like just because your parents came to this college doesn't give you the right to attend. These student have thier parents as a resource to navigating through college and should know what is expected

First Generation
Students don't have the same resource as legacy students and are at a disadvantage. Them attmpting to pursue a higher education is commendable.

Recommendation Letter
This is great but is not required

Extracurricular
Not heavily weighted but helps

Local
If the college wants to have the most commuinity outreach giving locals the opportunity of a higher education would do so. 

GPA
If the student has a 2.0 or higher that would be enough for this college, there may have been external factors that contributed to this grade that the student couldn't control

# Blind model

No changes were as this model will be most appropriate for colleges of a higher prestige and for students who are more acdemically inclind.
